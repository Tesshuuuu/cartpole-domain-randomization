# cartpole-domain-randomization

A neural network-based controller for the cart-pole system, implemented using JAX.

## Description
This project implements a trained controller for balancing an inverted pendulum on a cart (cart-pole system). The controller is trained using reinforcement learning techniques and can stabilize the pendulum from various initial conditions.

## Features
- Neural network controller implementation using JAX
- Training pipeline with customizable parameters
- Interactive simulation with matplotlib animations
- Support for saving and loading trained controllers
- Visualization of system states and control actions

## Requirements
python
numpy
matplotlib
jax

## Usage
Run the main script:
bash
python simulate_trained_controller.py

Choose whether to train a new controller or load an existing one when prompted.
